I'm a recent Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science at Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
My primary interest is in human language technologies, and my thesis was about the automated analyis of contracts using formal methods.
I also have a special interest in Maltese and in building digital linguistic resources for it.

Apart from being a researcher I'm also a seasoned programmer with a lot of experience with the web.
I consider myself an engineer who values good design and who is interested in the details of how things work in practice.
When not at my computer, I like to run trails and obstacle races.
I have also been known to write pretty well, give a decent speech, and geek over speciality coffee.

For more about my research, see my [academic homepage](academic/).
I share code on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjcamilleri)
and my professional life is summed up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnjcamilleri/).
The best way of contacting me is to email me at `john@` this domain.
