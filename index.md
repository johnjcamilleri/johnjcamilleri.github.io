I'm a Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science from Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
My primary interest is in language technology, and my [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/2077/53815) was about the automated analysis of contracts using formal methods.
I now work at [Digital Grammars](http://www.digitalgrammars.com), where I build multilingual systems and tools for grammar engineering and managing linguistic resources.
I also have a special interest in Maltese and started an [online lexicon](http://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/) for it.

I'm a seasoned programmer with a lot of experience with full-stack development.
I consider myself an engineer who values good design and who is interested in the details of how things work in practice.
When not at my computer, I like to run trails and fiddle with my espresso machine.

For more about my research, see my [academic page](academic/).
I share code on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjcamilleri)
and my professional life is summed up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnjcamilleri/).
The best way of contacting me is to email me at `john@` this domain.
