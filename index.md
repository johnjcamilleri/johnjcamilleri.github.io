I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
My primary research area is human language technologies, where I work on the automated analyis of contracts using formal methods.
I also have a special interest in Maltese and in building digital linguistic resources for it.

Apart from being a researcher I'm also a seasoned programmer with a lot of experience with the web.
I consider myself an engineer who values good design and who is interested in the details of how things work in practice.

When not at my computer, I like to train for and run obstacle races.
I have also been known to write pretty well, give a decent speech, and geek over speciality coffee.

For more about my research, see my [academic homepage](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~cajohn).
I share code on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjcamilleri)
and my professional life is summed up on [LinkedIn](http://mt.linkedin.com/in/johnjcamilleri).
The best way of contacting me is to email me at `john@` this domain.
