I'm a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. My primary research area is human language technologies, and I have a special interest in Maltese.

I do some web development, sometimes for work but mostly for pleasure. I'm into speciality coffee, obstacle races, and typography. I enjoy Röyksopp, lasagne, ﻿UTF-8, ﻿peach iced tea and randomised "I enjoy" lists.

For more about my research, see my [academic homepage](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~cajohn).
